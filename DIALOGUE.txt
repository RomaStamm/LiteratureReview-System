FHEVM EXAMPLES HUB - ONE MINUTE DIALOGUE SCRIPT

Welcome to FHEVM Examples Hub, your complete guide to building privacy-preserving smart contracts on blockchain.

In traditional blockchain applications, all data is visible to everyone. This is a problem. Balances, transactions, votes - everything is transparent. But what if we could compute on encrypted data without ever decrypting it?

That's where FHEVM comes in. Fully Homomorphic Encryption enables smart contracts to operate on encrypted values while maintaining complete privacy.

We've created the most comprehensive FHEVM learning resource available: 16 complete examples covering everything from basic homomorphic operations to advanced real-world applications.

Our collection includes:
- Three fundamental examples teaching encrypted addition, subtraction, and equality comparison
- Two examples demonstrating how to securely receive encrypted input with zero-knowledge proofs
- Four examples covering both private and public decryption scenarios
- Advanced applications like blind auctions, access control systems, and a complete literature review platform
- Educational content showing common mistakes and deep cryptographic concepts
- A confidential ERC20 token implementation inspired by OpenZeppelin

Every single example includes complete test coverage, well-commented code showing both correct and incorrect patterns, and production-ready implementations.

All examples are automatically generated into standalone repositories with pre-configured Hardhat setup, making it trivial to learn, modify, and deploy.

Whether you're building confidential DeFi applications, private governance systems, or fair auctions where bids remain secret, FHEVM Examples Hub gives you battle-tested patterns and comprehensive documentation.
